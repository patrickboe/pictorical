		<h1>About This Site</h1>
		
		<h2>My Motivation</h2>
		
		<p>I built this site because my wife is always like, "I really better take some pictures of the mural on such
		and such corner of Philadelphia, because you never know when they're just going to tear something like that
		down, and I've always liked that mural." I realized that there are already probably plenty of photos of that
		corner, geotagged with that location, publicly available on sites like <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.panoramio.com">Panoramio</a>, and <a href="http://www.picasa.com">Picasa</a>.</p>
		
		<p>In fact, in the years since Flickr first started supporting geotagging, they've amassed what amounts to a recent 
		photographic history of many small places in the world. We should spend time enjoying this accomplishment. 
		Using the information that Flickr and Panoramio publish about these public images, I put together this historical
		slideshow application. It shows a slideshow of the most "interesting" public photos in an area, from oldest to 
		newest. At its best, it's a visual survey of a place's history. I think it makes for some fun viewing. While I 
		was testing it, the images that popped up reminded me of places in my city that I love. I hope you will 
		find the same things.</p>
		
		<h2>The Images</h2>
		
		<p>All the images displayed on this site are provided by their owners for public viewing on any site.</p>
		
		<p>In the case of Flickr images, this site only displays images marked "public" and carrying a license which allows
		for reuse with attribution. Images on Flickr that are publicly accessible but marked "All Rights
		Reserved" (the default) are excluded from this application. So, if your images are on Flickr and you want them
		to show up in these slideshows, you must 
		<a href="http://www.flickr.com/account/prefs/license/" title="Flickr's license preferences page">apply some form of license</a>, 
		such as one of the 
		<a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/" title="Flickr's descriptions of Creative Commons licenses">Creative Commons licenses</a>.
		If your Flickr images are showing up on this site and you want them removed, you can do this in one of two ways:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Remove the permissive license from your photo in Flickr, marking it "All Rights Reserved" instead. You 
			can still keep it public. This will remove the photo from all compliant third-party applications, including 
			this one. It may take a few hours for this to kick in.</li>
			<li>If you want to keep your current license, but have your images removed from this website only, you can 
			send an email to remove@scenechange.net with the subject "remove" and only your user id in the message body. 
			Your user id is everything after "http://www.flickr.com/people/" in the url on your Flickr profile page. 
			Your images will be removed from this website within 24 hours.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>In the case of Panoramio images, this site displays all public images, per the rights granted to third party sites 
		like this one in Panoramio's user agreement.</p> 
		
		<h2>Contributions</h2>
		
		<p>As I write this, this site has virtually zero design. Help? If you have a stylesheet you think could make this look less
		like a dookie, I'd like to take a look at it. And really, I'm interested in any and all ideas for and better yet, 
		implementations of new features for the site.  You can get some ideas of where I might want to go with it by looking at
		the todo document in the project's <a href="http://github.com/patrickboe/pictorical">source code</a>. As far as money 
		is concerned, I'm not really taking any right now, because I haven't seen any hosting costs yet, I'm doing this for 
		fun, and I don't want to chance violating the terms of the NonCommercial licenses applied to many of the photos on 
		this site.</p>
